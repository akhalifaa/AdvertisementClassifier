# AdvertisementClassifier
## Project Overview:
 * A mini-machine learning project involving the creating of a logistic regression model that predicts whether a user clicks on an internet advertisement or not.
 * The data set contained information about users such as their daily time spent on the internet, age, area income, country and more...
 * This project involved exploring and cleaning data via various data visualization techniques, creating and training a logistic regression model and evalating its classification metrics. More importantly, as a part of creating the training data set, I implemented my take on feature engineering by adjusting the raw data set to include string and non-numerical data so that we could include more features and have a better trained model. I implemented functions such as splitting timestamps and assigning them to new columns and creating dummy variables for a the "Country" column where there was a selection of around 290 different countries.
 * Achieved a testing accuracy of 97%.
